Keep track of what people are adding or removing from their cart. See most added/removed products lists.

== Description ==
This plugin gives you a better insight into what people are adding or removing to/from their cart.
You can see all recorded carts in a table, as well as which products were added or removed most often.
Comparing cart data with your sales data can be helpful in **understanding what your customers want**.

Seeing actively removed products can also help you increase your sales by giving you the possibility to offer discounts for these products as an example.
Knowing what's happening on the customers side can be valuable in making data-informed decisions to boost your sales.

This plugin records customers carts as long as it's activated.
